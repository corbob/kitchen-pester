# Kitchen::Pester

Execute [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) tests right from Test-Kitchen, without having to transit the Busser layer.

## Usage

Either
```
gem install kitchen-pester
```
or include
```
gem 'kitchen-pester'
```
in your Gemfile.

In your .kitchen.yml include
```
verifier:
  name: pester
```
This can be a top-level declaration, a per-node declaration, or a per-suite declaration.

### Options

* `restart_winrm` - boolean, default is false.  This is primarily to support powershell v2 scenarios.  If Pester is not being found, enable this option.
* `test_folder` - string, default is nil.  `test-folder` allows you to specify a custom path (the default is ./test/integration/) for your integration tests.  This can be an absolute path or relative to the root of the folder kitchen is running from.  This path must exist.
